[PopupCamp](http://popupcamp.github.io) allows the Montreal community to self-organize itself and speak with one voice.

It is an open source Jekyll project which allows people to create internal/external events, showing times and information for anybody that wants to attend.

# The Problem we are solving
Many community activities conflict with one another, too many calendars on Facebook, specialized websites like Eventbrite, or independent events and communities announcing activities only to their mailinglists. Haphazard, much time wasted deciding where to go, which community to help out, etc.
